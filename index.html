<!-- Get a reset CSS in and some basic CSS styling. You can add more later. -->
<!-- You're gonna need a timer. Looks like attached to an initial click event. Everything is called off that. See classwork. -->
<!-- Questions appear in a card? A flexbox? -->

<!-- Things that appear in example: -->
<!-- Initial page with summary, start button, and all pages have view highscores link. -->
<!-- Questions. After the first question, each subsequent question displays whether you got the previous one right or wrong. Looks
      like this may be timed. I.e. 2-3 seconds on next display, if next answer isn't selected. -->
<!-- Final score display with input for initials -->
<!-- High scores display with all locally saved scores displaying (maybe limit number of scores shone?) -->
